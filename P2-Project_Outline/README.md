## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here

My App is aimed at women who like to go out to events and don’t want to go alone.
Maybe they have friends that are not into being in crowds or maybe they are in a
new city and want to meet other women. This is an App for women to meet up for a
friend date. It is a fun and more safe way to go out at night in the city.

Let’s say my city has a first Friday event night and I would like to go, but don’t
know anyone else that is going. I can open the App search for the event and see if
anyone else has posted “Interested” in going to the same event. I can send an invite
to her. She would get a notification that I also want to go to the same event. We can
connect and go together. We can decide to post that we are going if we would like
others to know they can “Join Us” or we can keep it private.

### Features
Include Features here

1. Friender will have a “Search” feature to search for events. It will have the
ability to pull events from city websites to keep current with what is happening now
and in the upcoming weeks.

2. Friender will have an “Interested” feature for women to choose that they are
interested in an event. It will post that they are interested in the event when
someone looks at the event. This will give others the option to send an “Invite” if
they are interested in going to the same event.

3. Friender will have a “Attending” feature. This will give women that connect and
decide to attend an event the option to keep their group open for other women to
“Join Us” or “Keep It Private”. By choosing “Join Us” they let other women know they
are attending and that they can join them. By choosing “Keep It Private” this option
will not post a notification under the event that they are “Attending”.

4. Friender will have a secure “User Signup” feature. You will have to submit to
multiple verifications to have a membership to the App. This is a connection for
women to be safe with other women and have fun. Safety will be a priority because
that is why I am creating the App in the first place. This is for women to feel free
to go out to have fun at city events and know they are making a smart decision by not
going alone. There must be strict membership verification and guidelines.


### Technologies
Include Technologies here

I am not certain of all the technologies that I will need to use to build my
application. I assume I will use Python, Java, Flask, MySQL, SQLAlchemy, Jinja2
templates, SpringBoot, MAMP and possibly others.

### What I'll Have to Learn
Include what you will need to learn here

I think I will be learning to use JavaScript to make my App more interactive. I
know that I will have to link to other websites to pull up to date events and post
them on my site. I also think I will create a way to use google maps on my App to
search events in my area.
